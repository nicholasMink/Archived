Basic measurement units:
========================

    * 1 meter = <39.3701> inches

    * 1 mile = <5,280> feet 
      
    * 1 mile = <1,609.34> meters

    * Circumference of the Earth = <24,901> miles


Basic terminology
=================

We prefix numbers in the world of science with some basic terms. Determine what
these mean:

    * `yotta` something = <10^(24)> times something
    
    * `kilo` something = <1000> times something

    * <centi> something = 100 times something
    
    * <deca> something = 10 times something

    * something = something (duh!)

    * `milli` something = 1/<100> of something

    * `micro` something = 1/<10^(6)> of something

    * `nano` something = 1/<10^(9)> of something

    * <pico>something = 1/1000000000000 of something

From Physics
============

* What is the speed of light 
  
    * = <186,282> mps (miles per second)

    * = <299,792> kps (kilometers per second)

Speed of Electronic Signals
===========================

Assuming electronic waves move through wire at the speed of light:

* How far an electronic signal can move through a wire:

    * In one nanosecond = <299792458000000000> inches

    * In one microsecond = <983571056430000> feet

    * In one millisecond = <1862.82> miles
    
    * In one second = <186282> miles

    * In one second = <7.5> times around the Earth!
